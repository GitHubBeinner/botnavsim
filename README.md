# Botnavsim

Botnavsim is Matt Blickem's final year MEng project at Loughborough University. When completed, Botnavsim will be a mobile robot simulation built in Unity3D.

## Aim

Create engaging demonstrations of a variety of navigational algorithms in a three dimensional space using simulated mobile robots, sensors and environments. 

## Objectives

* Create a robot simulation with a defined interface for navigational algorthims to demonstrate their behaviour.
* Log data from simulations in faster-than-realtime for easy comparison of different search algorithms.
* Simulate different kinds of robot locomotion, sensors and environments.

## Everything else

Planning and research in support of this project is being coordinated on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/1zd9z3g7/fyp).
