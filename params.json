{"name":"Botnavsim","tagline":"Mobile robot simulation (final year project)","body":"# Botnavsim\r\n\r\nBotnavsim is Matt Blickem's final year MEng project at Loughborough University. When completed, Botnavsim will be a mobile robot simulation built in Unity3D. \r\n\r\n## Aim\r\n\r\nCreate engaging demonstrations of a variety of navigational algorithms in a three dimensional space using simulated mobile robots, sensors and environments. \r\n\r\n## Objectives\r\n\r\n* Create a robot simulation with a defined interface for navigational algorthims to demonstrate their behaviour.\r\n* Log data from simulations in faster-than-realtime for easy comparison of different search algorithms.\r\n* Simulate different kinds of robot locomotion, sensors and environments.\r\n\r\n## Everything else\r\n\r\nPlanning and research in support of this project is being coordinated on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/1zd9z3g7/fyp).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
